# MarkScraper
Python web scraper to fetch marks from my university website.

## wb372 Marks

This is a function that will fetch the current wb372 marks. The marks will be
displayed in terminal, as well as be inserted into a csv.

This can be executed with the following code

```
python3 wb372.py [debug] [student number] [first year of registration] [birthday
(yyyy-mm-dd)]
```

The debug argument can be used on its own, but in order to correctly find your
own marks, all of the other arguments must be filled in correctly.

The *display_data* function also shows you how many people are better than me,
just incase anyone was wondering.
